### What to submit
A git repo with your modifications to the provided notebook.

You can adopt well known optimizers, also you can design your own optimizer.

Just follow the instructions in jupyter notebook.
1. Fill in Optimizer class. You can modify code, but `wind_attack`.
2. Provide intuition behind your optimizer.
