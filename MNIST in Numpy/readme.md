# MNIST in Numpy

## Project Outline
The aim of this project is to design a Neural Network for the MNIST dataset entirely in Numpy with Python. This involves implementing the DataLoader, Model, Losses, Backproagations and other required modules without the use of external libraries (other than Numpy).

### DataSet
MNIST is a set of low-resolution binary images of handwritten digits from 0-9. The first step is to download the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and create a DataLoader. **Do not** rely on existing modules, e.g. Tensorflow or PyTorch Datasets. 

### Model
Implement the model; this includes linear network layers, activations, and anything else required. 

### Learning
Implement losses and backpropagations through the network. Use any loss function you see fit, or better yet, compare multiple commonly used functions. **Rememeber the use of Chain Rule**.

### Results
Train until you are satisfied and report your results.

## Things to Consider
 - Although you have freedom in the structure of your implementation, please make sure code is modularized to best readability and understability.
 - Functionality is more important than Accuracy; make sure a basic model works before attempting to add extras.
 - You will need to explain your through process in layouts and implementations, think carefully about these processes.


### *Bonus Points*
Can you think of additions that will improve your results? How might you implement these changes in Numpy? Implement and test, or explain the process you might follow, and why you think they will give improvement to your results.
