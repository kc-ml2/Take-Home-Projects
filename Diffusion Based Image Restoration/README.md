## Diffusion Based Image Restoration
### What to do 
1. This [repo](https://github.com/yuhuUSTC/DehazeDDPM) has an issue with the inference step as discussed [here](https://github.com/yuhuUSTC/DehazeDDPM/issues/8)
2. The task is to read this paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11949) and find the possible issue.

### Note:
- The goal of this task is that the candidate fully understand the Diffusion in general and Diffusion for Image restoration task.
- So, we suggest the candidate to start from basic understanding of Diffusion models.
