The dataset is about Arrhythmia, which is a heart disease and can be detected by ECG(heartbeat) signal.
The problem in the data is: Normal and abnormal data data are largely biased(Mostly normal). (Abnormal has multiple types each having small data number)
This deteriorates the classfication problem to detect patients from the signal.
